- G1.2 Statistical Software should include a* Life Cycle Statement *describing current and anticipated future states of development.* 

- G1.5 Software should include all code necessary to reproduce results which form the basis of performance claims made in associated publications.* 

- G2.11 Software should ensure that `data.frame`-like tabular objects which have columns which do not themselves have standard class attributes (typically, `vector`) are appropriately processed, and do not error without reason. This behaviour should be tested. Again, columns created by the [`units` package](https://github.com/r-quantities/units/) provide a good test case.

- G2.12 Software should ensure that `data.frame`-like tabular objects which have list columns should ensure that those columns are appropriately pre-processed either through being removed, converted to equivalent vector columns where appropriate, or some other appropriate treatment such as an informative error. This behaviour should be tested.* 

- G2.14b ignore missing data with default warnings or messages issued

- G2.14c replace missing data with appropriately imputed values

- G2.4 Provide appropriate mechanisms to convert between different data types, potentially including:

- G2.4e explicit conversion from factor via `as...()` functions

- G2.8 Software should provide appropriate conversion or dispatch routines as part of initial pre-processing to ensure that all other sub-functions of a package receive inputs of a single defined class or type.

- G2.9 Software should issue diagnostic messages for type conversion in which information is lost (such as conversion of variables from factor to character; standardisation of variable names; or removal of meta-data such as those associated with [`sf`-format](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) data) or added (such as insertion of variable or column names where none were provided).* 

- G3.0 Statistical software should never compare floating point numbers for equality. All numeric equality comparisons should either ensure that they are made between integers, or use appropriate tolerances for approximate equality.* 

- G3.1 Statistical software which relies on covariance calculations should enable users to choose between different algorithms for calculating covariances, and should not rely solely on covariances from the `stats::cov` function.

- G3.1a The ability to use arbitrarily specified covariance methods should be documented (typically in examples or vignettes).* 

- G4.0 Statistical Software which enables outputs to be written to local files should parse parameters specifying file names to ensure appropriate file suffices are automatically generated where not provided.* 

- G5.10 Extended tests should included and run under a common framework with other tests but be switched on by flags such as as a `<MYPKG>_EXTENDED_TESTS="true"` environment variable.* - The extended tests can be then run automatically by GitHub Actions for example by adding the following to the `env` section of the workflow: 

- G5.11 Where extended tests require large data sets or other assets, these should be provided for downloading and fetched as part of the testing workflow.

- G5.11a When any downloads of additional data necessary for extended tests fail, the tests themselves should not fail, rather be skipped and implicitly succeed with an appropriate diagnostic message.

- G5.12 Any conditions necessary to run extended tests such as platform requirements, memory, expected runtime, and artefacts produced that may need manual inspection, should be described in developer documentation such as a `CONTRIBUTING.md` or `tests/README.md` file.

- G5.4c Where applicable, stored values may be drawn from published paper outputs when applicable and where code from original implementations is not available

- G5.2 Appropriate error and warning behaviour of all functions should be explicitly demonstrated through tests. In particular,

- G5.2a Every message produced within R code by `stop()`, `warning()`, `message()`, or equivalent should be unique

- G5.2b Explicit tests should demonstrate conditions which trigger every one of those messages, and should compare the result with expected values.

- G5.3 For functions which are expected to return objects containing no missing (`NA`) or undefined (`NaN`, `Inf`) values, the absence of any such values in return objects should be explicitly tested.* 

- G5.4a For new methods, it can be difficult to separate out correctness of the method from the correctness of the implementation, as there may not be reference for comparison. In this case, testing may be implemented against simple, trivial cases or against multiple implementations such as an initial R implementation compared with results from a C/C++ implementation.

- G5.4b For new implementations of existing methods, correctness tests should include tests against previous implementations. Such testing may explicitly call those implementations in testing, preferably from fixed-versions of other software, or use stored outputs from those where that is not possible.

- G5.5 Correctness tests should be run with a fixed random seed

- G5.6 *Parameter recovery tests** *to test that the implementation produce expected results given data with known properties. For instance, a linear regression algorithm should return expected coefficient values for a simulated data set generated from a linear model.

- G5.6a Parameter recovery tests should generally be expected to succeed within a defined tolerance rather than recovering exact values.

- G5.7 *Algorithm performance tests** *to test that implementation performs as expected as properties of data change. For instance, a test may show that parameters approach correct estimates within tolerance as data size increases, or that convergence times decrease for higher convergence thresholds.
