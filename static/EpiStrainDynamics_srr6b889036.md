Standards on line#106 of file [R/srr-stats-standards.R](https://github.com/acefa-hubs/EpiStrainDynamics/blob/main/R/srr-stats-standards.R#L106):

- G1.6 Software should include code necessary to compare performance claims with alternative implementations in other R packages.* 

- G2.11 Software should ensure that `data.frame`-like tabular objects which have columns which do not themselves have standard class attributes (typically, `vector`) are appropriately processed, and do not error without reason. This behaviour should be tested. Again, columns created by the [`units` package](https://github.com/r-quantities/units/) provide a good test case.

- G2.12 Software should ensure that `data.frame`-like tabular objects which have list columns should ensure that those columns are appropriately pre-processed either through being removed, converted to equivalent vector columns where appropriate, or some other appropriate treatment such as an informative error. This behaviour should be tested.* 

- G2.14b ignore missing data with default warnings or messages issued

- G2.14c replace missing data with appropriately imputed values

- G2.4c explicit conversion to character via `as.character()` (and not `paste` or `paste0`)

- G2.4d explicit conversion to factor via `as.factor()`

- G2.4e explicit conversion from factor via `as...()` functions

- G2.5 Where inputs are expected to be of `factor` type, secondary documentation should explicitly state whether these should be `ordered` or not, and those inputs should provide appropriate error or other routines to ensure inputs follow these expectations.* 

- G2.6 Software which accepts one-dimensional input should ensure values are appropriately pre-processed regardless of class structures.* 

- G2.9 Software should issue diagnostic messages for type conversion in which information is lost (such as conversion of variables from factor to character; standardisation of variable names; or removal of meta-data such as those associated with [`sf`-format](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) data) or added (such as insertion of variable or column names where none were provided).* 

- G3.1 Statistical software which relies on covariance calculations should enable users to choose between different algorithms for calculating covariances, and should not rely solely on covariances from the `stats::cov` function.

- G3.1a The ability to use arbitrarily specified covariance methods should be documented (typically in examples or vignettes).* 

- G4.0 Statistical Software which enables outputs to be written to local files should parse parameters specifying file names to ensure appropriate file suffixes are automatically generated where not provided.* 

- G5.0 Where applicable or practicable, tests should use standard data sets with known properties (for example, the [NIST Standard Reference Datasets](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/strd/), or data sets provided by other widely-used R packages).

- G5.10 Extended tests should included and run under a common framework with other tests but be switched on by flags such as as a `<MYPKG>_EXTENDED_TESTS="true"` environment variable.* - The extended tests can be then run automatically by GitHub Actions for example by adding the following to the `env` section of the workflow: 

- G5.11 Where extended tests require large data sets or other assets, these should be provided for downloading and fetched as part of the testing workflow.

- G5.11a When any downloads of additional data necessary for extended tests fail, the tests themselves should not fail, rather be skipped and implicitly succeed with an appropriate diagnostic message.

- G5.12 Any conditions necessary to run extended tests such as platform requirements, memory, expected runtime, and artefacts produced that may need manual inspection, should be described in developer documentation such as a `CONTRIBUTING.md` or `tests/README.md` file.

- G5.4a For new methods, it can be difficult to separate out correctness of the method from the correctness of the implementation, as there may not be reference for comparison. In this case, testing may be implemented against simple, trivial cases or against multiple implementations such as an initial R implementation compared with results from a C/C++ implementation.

- G5.4b For new implementations of existing methods, correctness tests should include tests against previous implementations. Such testing may explicitly call those implementations in testing, preferably from fixed-versions of other software, or use stored outputs from those where that is not possible.

- G5.4c Where applicable, stored values may be drawn from published paper outputs when applicable and where code from original implementations is not available

- G5.6 *Parameter recovery tests** *to test that the implementation produce expected results given data with known properties. For instance, a linear regression algorithm should return expected coefficient values for a simulated data set generated from a linear model.

- G5.6a Parameter recovery tests should generally be expected to succeed within a defined tolerance rather than recovering exact values.

- G5.6b Parameter recovery tests should be run with multiple random seeds when either data simulation or the algorithm contains a random component. (When long-running, such tests may be part of an extended, rather than regular, test suite; see G5.10-4.12, below).* 

- BS1.0 Bayesian software which uses the term "hyperparameter" should explicitly clarify the meaning of that term in the context of that software.* 

- BS1.3a Bayesian Software should document, both in text and examples, how to use the output of previous simulations as starting points of subsequent simulations.* 

- BS1.3b Where applicable, Bayesian software should document, both in text and examples, how to use different sampling algorithms for a given model.

- BS1.5 For Bayesian Software which implements or otherwise enables multiple convergence checkers, differences between these should be explicitly tested.* 

- BS2.1 Bayesian Software should implement pre-processing routines to ensure all input data is dimensionally commensurate, for example by ensuring commensurate lengths of vectors or numbers of rows of tabular inputs.

- BS2.10 Issue diagnostic messages when identical seeds are passed to distinct computational chains.

- BS2.13 Bayesian Software should enable suppression of messages and progress indicators, while retaining verbosity of warnings and errors. This should be tested.

- BS2.14 Bayesian Software should enable suppression of warnings where appropriate. This should be tested.

- BS2.1a The effects of such routines should be tested.* 

- BS2.6 Check that values for computational parameters lie within plausible ranges.* 

- BS2.8 Enable results of previous runs to be used as starting points for subsequent runs.* 

- BS2.9 Ensure each chain is started with a different seed by default.

- BS3.1 Implement pre-processing routines to diagnose perfect collinearity, and provide appropriate diagnostic messages or warnings

- BS3.2 Provide distinct routines for processing perfectly collinear data, potentially bypassing sampling algorithms* 

- BS4.0 Packages should document sampling algorithms (generally via literary citation, or reference to other software)

- BS4.1 Packages should provide explicit comparisons with external samplers which demonstrate intended advantage of implementation (generally via tests, vignettes, or both).* 

- BS4.4 Enable computations to be stopped on convergence (although not necessarily by default).

- BS4.6 Implement tests to confirm that results with convergence checker are statistically equivalent to results from equivalent fixed number of samples without convergence checking.

- BS4.7 Where convergence checkers are themselves parametrised, the effects of such parameters should also be tested. For threshold parameters, for example, lower values should result in longer sequence lengths.* 

- BS5.3 Bayesian Software should return convergence statistics or equivalent

- BS5.4 Where multiple checkers are enabled, Bayesian Software should return details of convergence checker used

- BS6.0 Software should implement a default `print` method for return objects

- BS6.4 Software may provide `summary` methods for return objects

- BS7.0 Software should demonstrate and confirm recovery of parametric estimates of a prior distribution

- BS7.1 Software should demonstrate and confirm recovery of a prior distribution in the absence of any additional data or information

- BS7.2 Software should demonstrate and confirm recovery of a expected posterior distribution given a specified prior and some input data*
