## Standards with `srrstats` tag



**Numbers of standards:**

-  G :  7  /  8

-  RE :  1  /  4

- Total : 8 / 12





### R directory



Standards in  on line#11 of file R/test.R:

- G1.1 Statistical Software should document whether the algorithm(s) it implements are:* - *The first implementation of a novel algorithm*; or - *The first implementation within **R** of an algorithm which has previously been implemented in other languages or contexts*; or - *An improvement on other implementations of similar algorithms in **R***. 

- G1.2 Statistical Software should include a* Life Cycle Statement *describing current and anticipated future states of development.* 

- G1.3 All statistical terminology should be clarified and unambiguously defined.* 

- G2.0 Implement assertions on lengths of inputs, particularly through asserting that inputs expected to be single- or multi-valued are indeed so.

- G2.1 Implement assertions on types of inputs (see the initial point on nomenclature above).



### tests directory



Standards in  on line#2 of file tests/testthat/test-a.R:

- RE2.2 Regression Software should provide different options for processing missing values in predictor and response data. For example, it should be possible to fit a model with no missing predictor data in order to generate values for all associated response points, even where submitted response values may be missing.



### src directory



Standards in function 'test()' on line#6 of file src/cpptest.cpp:

- G2.3 For univariate character input:



### root directory



Standards in  on line#17 of file ./README.Rmd:

- G1.4 Software should use [`roxygen2`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/) to document all functions.

## Standards with `srrstatsNA` tag



**Numbers of standards:**

-  G :  0  /  8

-  RE :  1  /  4

- Total : 1 / 12





### R directory



Standards in  on line#5 of file R/srr-stats-standards.R:

- RE3.3 Allow explicit setting of convergence thresholds, unless reasons against doing so are explicitly documented.*

## Standards with `srrstatsTODO` tag



**Numbers of standards:**

-  G :  1  /  8

-  RE :  2  /  4

- Total : 3 / 12





### R directory



Standards in  on line#14 of file R/srr-stats-standards.R:

- RE4.4 The specification of the model, generally as a formula (via `formula()`)

Standards in  on line#11 of file R/test.R:

- RE1.1 Regression Software should document how formula interfaces are converted to matrix representations of input data.* 



### root directory



Standards in  on line#17 of file ./README.Rmd:

- G1.5 Software should include all code necessary to reproduce results which form the basis of performance claims made in associated publications.*
